Version 0.1.2
=============
Bugfix release/minor features.

* Utilities
	* hexdump uses nepenthes.utilites.hexdump_path as pathinfo now
	
* shellemu-wint
	* VFSCommandFTP uses new DownloadFlags

* Download 
	* added DownloadFlags so we can handle broken ftpds better
	* added ::addFlag(uint8_t ) & ::getFlags()

* DownloadManager 
	* download() now takes uint8_t downloadflags as argument

* download-ftp
	* bind to port 0 to avoid collision
	* rewrote quite everything to handle broken ftp daemons better, including the new DownloadFlags

* Socket
	* changed SS_NULL to SS_CONNECTED
	* added SS_CONNECTING

	
* TCPSocket 
	* set localip on accept() Sockets, so we can use this info further
	* bind ConnectSockets before connecting, so we use the same ip for reverseconnect shells
	* uses SS_CONNECTING for connect sockets
	* overloads setState(), so if they are in state SS_CONNECTING and goto SS_CONNECTED they 
		can call Dialogue::connectionEstablished() for their dialogues

	* some changes in the TCPSockets internal Dialogue handling prevent nepenthes recognizing 
		the same shellcode in more than one dialogue, resulting in more than one download per exploit
		
		
* vuln-dameware
	* created
	
* Dialogue
	* added ::dump()
	* added ::connectionEstablished()

	
* many vuln-* modules
	* added CL_ASSIGN_AND_DONE handling


* many shellcodehandlers using downloadhandler
	* added valid downloadflag usage



Version 0.1.1
=============
Bugfix release/minor features.

This is the first release featuring auto(conf|make|broken|whatever) support.
Maximillian Dornseif had enough time to burn to write configure.whatever 
and such stuff for everything so far.


* Compile fixes for 
	* Mac OSX	
	* FreeBSD

* Nepenthes
	* Added functionality for -d and -l command line options (log filtering).
	* Handle SIGINT on -f (command line) usage.
	* -V is now version.
	* -v is now verbose, useful for -f when debugging new shellcodehandlers.
	* DownloadBuffer now features cutFront(unsigned int len)

* Veritas Backup Exec Exploit for port 10000 added.
	* shellcode-generic
		* Konstanz XOR added as sch_generic_konstanz_xor.
		* Konstanz connectback shell pattern added to shellcode-generic.conf.dist.
	* Removed VERITASDialogue for port 10000 hexdump, added shellcodehandling.


* shellcode-generic
	* Fixed sch_generic_connect.
	* Added sch_generic_connect_trans and Halle PCRE.
	* Added sch_generic_xor Halle.

* vuln-dcom
	* Fixed oc192 PCRE.
	* Removed SOL2k shellcode handler, as they were never seen during the last two months.

* download-csend
	* the atoi(url->path) is cut from the download buffer to be able to use csend with halle
	
* vuln-iis 
	* Handle NULL if binding the socket fails in a useful manner
	
* vuln-pnp
	* added
	* handles the MS05-039 exploit by houseofdabus
	
* vuln-lsass 
	* fixed some lines to work properly with vuln-pnp

* Utilities
	* sha512 added
	
* shellemu-wint
	* VFSCommandCMD
	the first command after the /c has to be readded to the StdIn queue, like we did before,
	but we have to add a delimiter '&' so we dont break our own parsing.

* Download 
	* added SHA512 get & set methods

* SubmitManager 
	* set SHA512 for downloads

* tools/rpcxmlxfer
	* there is an early implementation of an central collection and
	logging protocol called rpcxmlxfer in this release. The prototype is
	implemented as an external script. Just add something like
          */5 * * * * nobody /opt/nepenthes/bin/rpcxmlxfer-client -q
	to your /etc/crontab to try it.

* download-ftp
	* bind to port 0 to avoid collision

* Socket
	* changed SS_NULL to SS_CONNECTED
	* added SS_CONNECTING
	
* TCPSocket 
	* set localip on accept() Sockets, so we can use this info further
	* bind ConnectSockets before connecting, so we use the same ip for reverseconnect shells
	* uses SS_CONNECTING for connect sockets
	* overloads setState(), so if they are in state SS_CONNECTING and goto SS_CONNECTED they 
		can call Dialogue::connectionEstablished() for their dialogues
		

* submit-xmlrpc
	* created
	* depends on vuln-lsass 
	
* vuln-dameware
	* created
	
* Dialogue
	* added dump()
