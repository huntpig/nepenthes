BUG: Failed outgoing TCP connections don't get close()'d quickly.

UDP Support
===========
Currently, there is no good UDP support. Nepenthes has no concept of accept()
for UDP "sessions", and as such each vulnerability module will have to track
its own state between hosts. This prevents us from using log-attack to hold
UDP socket state per "session" -- a UDP session framework should be added to
Nepenthes beforehand.
